# Herrarchial Clustering Using R

## Intro

R is a natural place to play with data and collections of natural / artificial data recorders, commonly in the form of electronic devices, ranging fromm cell phones to embedded platforms.

## Process

1. Install R
2. Prepare csv from input file (Excel .xlsx)
3. Start R

## Assignment

2. Excel Sheet to be downloaded from link provided
3. Perform MBA Using R and share most watched
4. Create appropriate visualizations to describe variables and answer  the following questions :
    * Find top 3 movies?
    * Which age range likes superhero movies?
5. Using Hierarchial Clustering to find which gender / age group likes which of the top favourite movies?

## Solution

### Loading Excel Data

First Excel file needs to be converted to a CSV file by going to `File -> Save As` and selecting CSV (comma seperated values) as the format. 
Now it's time to load up R from any console and get to the R shell. The csv file can be loaded by calling `read.csv()` function

```{r} 
DF<-read.csv('input.csv',sep=';')
head(DF)
```

The data from the file is now in the variable `DF` and the column names can be seen by calling `colnames()` function 


```{r} 
print(colnames(DF))
```

### Perform MBA Using R and share most watched

By using builtin summary of the column "favourite movie" we find that the top 10 movies are : 
```{r}
head(summary(DF$favourite),n=10)
```

### Visualizations to describe variables to answer the following :
 * Find top 3 movies?
```{r}
head(summary(DF$favourite),n=4)
```
Ignoring the first entry as it contains empty spaces in the survey dataset

 * Which age range likes superhero movies?





```{r}
#DF$Age
#DF$Age<-as.integer(as.factor(DF$Age))
#DF$Age<-scale(DF$Age)

#for (col in colnames(DF)){
#print('Doing')
#print(col)
#DF[col]<-as.integer(as.factor(DF[col]))
#DF[col]<-scale(DF[col])
#}
```
```{r} 
for (col in 1:ncol(DF)){
#print('Doing')
#print(col)
DF[,col]<-as.integer(as.factor(DF[,col]))
DF[,col]<-scale(DF[,col])
}
#str(DF)
dist_matrix=dist(DF,method='euclidean')
hclust_avg=hclust(dist_matrix,method='average')
plot(hclust_avg)
```
```{r} 
#cut_avg=cutree(hclust_avg,k=3)
#rect.hclust(hclust_avg,k=3,border=2:6)
#abline(h=3,col='red')
```
```{r} 
#avg_dend_obj=as.dendrogram(hclust_avg)
#suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dendextend))
#avg_col_dend=color_branches(avg_dend_obj,h=3)
#plot(avg_col_dend)




```
